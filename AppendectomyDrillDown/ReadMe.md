Building on the original cost benchmarking example, focus on a specific procedure (appendectomies) and build the drill-path that many were asking.  
For OR time, break the activity down into a minutes, # of FTEs, cost per FTE.  
For drugs, break down and compare % of patients administered and units per patient if used to the benchmark. 
For LOS, break down by actual days stayed and cost per day.  

Incorporate and visualize more and better outcome metrics, etc.
