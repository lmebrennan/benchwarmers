"Challenge: Which drug is most cost effective for the prevention of blood clots after Total Knee and Total Hip Replacement surgeries.

1) Low Molecular Weight Heparin – Lovenox or Fragmin ($20-$30 daily injection during IP stay)

2) SubQ Heparin – Generic (cheaper injection during IP stay)

3) Warfarin/Coumadin – been around for a million years (cheap pill, must be taken for 30 days and requires lab monitoring)

4) The new guys in the market – Pradaxa, Xarelto, Eliquis (pill, does not require lab monitoring – not sure how long they should be taken after surgery)

5) Aspirin (cheap pill, taken during IP stay)"
